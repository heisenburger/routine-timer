# routine-timer

Hello, I am someone who has perpertually struggled to keep a routine. I've seen a few routine timers floating around and have been meaning to try them, but frankly they all look ugly and that makes me not want to use them. So naturally, I'm here, building my own app (rather than doing healthier things to fix my habits, like actually going to sleep at a normal time).

The routines here are hardcoded, but feel free to fork this and put in your own ones if you wish. Just credit me at the end or something, i dunno.

## game plan

- [x] start with the timer page layout and styles
  - [x] routine name
  - [x] current task
  - [x] shuffle component
  - [x] countdown timer
  - [x] overtime counter
  - [x] next task
- [ ] add countdown behaviour
  - [x] timer
  - [x] timer ring
  - [x] overtime counter
  - [ ] next task shows when <30s remaining
- [ ] create some kind of data structure to hold the routine info
  - [ ] make the timer consume from this data
  - [ ] previous task
  - [ ] next task
  - [ ] shuffle
- [ ] extra functionality
  - [ ] next task button activates only after 1 min, if unskippable
  - [ ] create homepage; move timer to own page
